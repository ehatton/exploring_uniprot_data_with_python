# Exploring UniProt data with python

This Jupyter notebook was created for the API section of the "Bioinformatics Resources for Protein Biology" course held at EMBL-EBI on 28th February 2019.

It provides a few simple examples showing how to use python to explore UniProt data programmatically, via the EBI [Proteins API](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/proteins/api/doc/).

## Requirements
